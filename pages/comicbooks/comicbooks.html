        <p class="lead">
          The story is set in an alternate future of the DC Universe. The new generation of heroes have lost their moral compass, becoming as reckless and violent as the villains they once fought. The previous regime of heroes—the Justice League—returns under dire circumstances, which sets up a battle of the old guard against these uncompromising protectors in a conflict that will define what heroism truly is and determine the future of the planet
          <br>
          <br>
          I consider it one of the best comic books ever made, with a wonderful script and incredible art. I always recommend people read this work of art.

          Secret Wars (2015) is a Marvel Comics event that follows the collapse of the multiverse, forcing heroes and villains from different realities to survive on a mysterious world <br> formed from fragments of destroyed universes, where alliances are tested br and the fate of reality itself is at stake.
          <br>
          <br>
          I read a lot of it as a child; I was fascinated by the main story and the spin-offs. I greatly admire the art of comics.

        <p class="lead">
          Five boys who love football decide to start a local amateur team. One hundred years later, they are still remembered for founding one of the biggest clubs in the country: Sport Club Corinthians Paulista. Much has happened in this century, and the Editora Globo release "Todo-Poderoso Timão em Quadrinhos" (All-Powerful Timão in Comics) is responsible for recounting the team's landmark history in the fun language of comic books, bringing to life the main events, symbols, achievements, and even defeats of Timão (Corinthians' nickname). The illustrations are by cartoonist Ziraldo, who created a family of original characters especially for this book. All to narrate the team's history and celebrate its centenary.
          <br>
          <br>
          A beautiful comic book that explains the history of one of the biggest clubs in Brazil. Featuring stunning artwork by Ziraldo.

        <h3 class="fw-bold">Watchmen</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          It's a mystery story that deconstructs the superhero genre, set in an alternate reality of the United States in 1985, on the brink of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. The plot explores the morality and psychology of masked vigilantes in a world that has outlawed them.
          <br>
          <br>
          When I got the Omnibus version, I simply loved the story. Easily one of the best comic books of all time.

          To prevent the collision of our universe with another, the Illuminati, led by the Black Panther, must assemble NOW! It's the most powerful and brilliant team in the Marvel Universe--The Black Panther, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Black Bolt, Mister Fantastic, Namor the Sub-Mariner and The Beast--against an infinite legion of parallel realities.

          <br>
          One of the best Avengers runs I've ever read. With a very elaborate story and art by Mike Deodato, a talented Brazilian artist.
