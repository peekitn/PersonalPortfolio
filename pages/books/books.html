        <p class="lead">
          In his book, "Por que fazemos o que fazemos?", philosopher and writer Mario Sergio Cortella explores the main concerns regarding work. Divided into twenty chapters, he addresses issues such as the importance of having a life with purpose, motivation in difficult times, values, and loyalty to oneself and one's job.
          <br><br>
          It's a very good book for reflection; throughout the book you try to understand more about your life.

        <p class="lead">
          This report, in addition to being a historical document about the national liberation struggles and socialist revolutions in the region during the 1960s and 1970s, represents a faithful description of how the people fought, depicting the life of the Vietnamese people in the liberated zones, with their self-organization in defense, education, culture, health, and food production.

        <p class="lead">
          In "Football: Geopolitics", José Eduardo de Carvalho provides a detailed analysis of the sport that has sparked conflicts and also overcome wars, thus becoming an essential piece in the intricate game of world diplomacy and geopolitics. Beyond its extraordinary economic potential, football can also make a valuable contribution to world peace.
          <br><br>
          I love football and political topics, so this book combines the two and demonstrates how politics has always influenced football.
